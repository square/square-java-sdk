| `MatchProductsId` | `String` | Optional | Unique ID for the `CatalogProductSet` that will be matched by this rule. A match rule<br>matches within the entire cart, and can match multiple times. This field will always be set. | String getMatchProductsId() |
| `ApplyProductsId` | `String` | Optional | __Deprecated__: Please use the `exclude_products_id` field to apply<br>an exclude set instead. Exclude sets allow better control over quantity<br>ranges and offer more flexibility for which matched items receive a discount.<br><br>`CatalogProductSet` to apply the pricing to.<br>An apply rule matches within the subset of the cart that fits the match rules (the match set).<br>An apply rule can only match once in the match set.<br>If not supplied, the pricing will be applied to all products in the match set.<br>Other products retain their base price, or a price generated by other rules. | String getApplyProductsId() |
| `ExcludeProductsId` | `String` | Optional | `CatalogProductSet` to exclude from the pricing rule.<br>An exclude rule matches within the subset of the cart that fits the match rules (the match set).<br>An exclude rule can only match once in the match set.<br>If not supplied, the pricing will be applied to all products in the match set.<br>Other products retain their base price, or a price generated by other rules. | String getExcludeProductsId() |
