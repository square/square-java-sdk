| `GIFTCARDAVAILABLEAMOUNT` | When using a gift card as a payment source in a `CreatePayment` request, you can allow<br>taking partial payment by adding the `accept_partial_authorization` parameter in the request.<br>If the gift card does not have sufficient balance to pay the entire `amount_money` specified<br>in the request, the request will succeed (an APPROVED payment for the remaining balance will be<br>returned). For more information, see [Partial amount with Square gift cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/payments-api/take-payments#partial-payment-gift-card).\r\n\r\n<br>However, taking such a partial payment does not work if your request also includes `tip_money`,<br>`app_fee_money`, or both. Square declines such payment and returns this error.\r\n* The error<br>details provide the amount that was available on the gift card at the time of the request.<br>The amount is a string representation in the smallest denomination of the applicable currency.<br>For example, in USD the amount is specified in cents.\r\n* The error code appears in an array<br>along with the INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS error.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example set of<br>errors:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"errors\": [\r\n    {\r\n  \"code\": \"INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS\",\r\n      \"detail\": \"Gift card does not have sufficient balance for requested amount and tip.\",\r\n      \"category\": \"PAYMENT_METHOD_ERROR\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"code\": \"GIFT_CARD_AVAILABLE_AMOUNT\",\r\n      \"detail\": \"4494\",\r\n      \"category\": \"PAYMENT_METHOD_ERROR\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<br>In addition to the errors, it shows the gift card balance at 44.94 USD. You can review this amount and submit a new `CreatePayment` request with `tip_money` and `amount_money` that fit within the available balance. |
