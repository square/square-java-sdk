
# Invoice Recipient

Represents a snapshot of customer data. This object stores customer data that is displayed on the invoice
and that Square uses to deliver the invoice.

When you provide a customer ID for a draft invoice, Square retrieves the associated customer profile and populates
the remaining `InvoiceRecipient` fields. You cannot update these fields after the invoice is published.
Square updates the customer ID in response to a merge operation, but does not update other fields.
